Run `python3.6 main.py` to train model. The training process and performance on validation set are displayed for each epoch. `tqdm` need to be installed.

One dictionary file for words and one pretrained vector file is needed for running `main.py`. It can be generated by running `python3.6 preprocess.py` if `crawl-300d-2M.vec` is given which is the original pretrained vector file from https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip.

The corpus data directory `topicclass` should be place at root directory.
